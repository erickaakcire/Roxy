							What does Roxy log?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							You have complete control over what Roxy logs. If you choose a "private" session nothing is logged. You can also specify specific websites you do not want Roxy to log. If you choose a "regular" session, Roxy only logs insecure web pages (those that start with http rather than https). All reputable bank sites and online shopping carts are secure and use https. Also, Roxy does not log any web-based email, Facebook, or an extensive list of adult websites.
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							How do I know what Roxy has logged?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							You can see everything Roxy has logged. Once you have logged in to Roxy just go to the History &amp; Blacklist link on the right-hand side of the main Roxy page.
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							How do I blacklist or delete websites that Roxy has logged?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							Just go to the <a href="/history">History &amp; Blacklist</a> link in Roxy and choose from any of the pages Roxy has logged. 
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							Is my data confidential?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							Yes, this study will never connect your name to your Roxy data (or any other data from the study). Reports about this project will usually refer to groups of people (e.g. seven people did xyz) but if your actions are mentioned it will be reported as "a 38 year old female did xyz" or a similarly general designation. Friends and family of the researcher recruited some of you to participate. We will not reveal that you are participating in this study to anyone, including these friends and family.
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							Is my data secure? 
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							Yes, Roxy uses all of the standard security measures for web applications so that the only people who will ever have access to your Roxy data are you and the resarchers of the Beyond the Click project. Roxy does not store any of your passwords for other websites so that your security cannot be breached.
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							I use a Mac or Linux computer. Can I use Roxy? 
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							Yes, Roxy is web-based so if you connect to the web in most cases you can use Roxy. 
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							Does Roxy log anything on my computer except for web pages?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							No, Roxy only logs web pages. Roxy doesn't have any access to your computer; it is a program you logon to online. 
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							How does Roxy work?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							Roxy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">a proxy server</a> that you login to on the web. It does not install any software that runs on your computer, it runs on a server like other web-based applications you login to use. When the research project is over and you take out Roxy's settings your computer remains unchanged by Roxy.
						</div> 
						<div class="section-header"> 
							Why was Roxy developed?
						</div> 
						<div class="section"> 
							Roxy was created because Internet researchers did not have a flexible and ethical way to gather web browsing data from research participants on a variety of computer platforms. Research ethics demand informed consent so Roxy was designed with transparency, privacy and user control as its primary goals.
