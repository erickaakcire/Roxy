							Overview

						<div class="section">
							<p>The first time you login you'll need to enter the user name and password you selected. Subsequent visits will not require you to input your name and password if you have cookies enabled on your browser.</p>
							<p>When you have not used the web for 30 minutes or more the Roxy home page will load and you can choose a "regular," "private" or "guest" session. If you choose "regular" your web browsing will be observed as part of the research project. If you choose "private" your web browsing will not be recorded. Choosing regular rather than private sessions helps the research project. The "guest" option is for people who may use this web browser who are not part of the research project. Once you choose a session type, Roxy automatically takes you to the site you were trying to go to (just wait a second or two). Thus, in general, your interaction with Roxy will involve just one click where you choose between a regular and a private session.</p>
							<p>Even when Roxy is in a "regular" session it will not gather content from sites that often contain personal information like web-based email, Facebook, or adult sites using an extensive 'blacklist' of such sites. Any site that is secure (starts with https rather than http) such as virtually all bank sites and web shopping checkout systems will also not be logged.</p>
							<p>You can change your session type by going to Roxy's main page (<a href="/">http://proxy.roxyproxy.org/</a>), ending your current session and starting a new one with the session type of your choice. We suggest you bookmark Roxy's main page for easy access to change session types or visit the History & Blacklist.</p>
							<p>The goal is for Roxy to interrupt you as little as possible, but still give you a choice about logging.</p>

							Deleting &amp; Blacklisting Sites
						</div>
						<div class="section">
							<p>If you want to delete some of the web pages from the log, or check to see what is logged, first make sure you are logged into Roxy (either Regular or Private session type, not guest) then click the link on the right side of Roxy's main page that says <a href="/history">"History & Blacklist"</a>.</p>
							<p>The quick blacklist lets you blacklist sites before Roxy ever logs them.</p>
							<p>If you want to delete or blacklist sites that you've visited during a regular session, all of the logged sites are listed in the "Full History" section of the page. If you cannot find the page, Roxy has not logged it. </p>
							<p>If you delete a page, that page is not saved in any way and will not be part of this research.</p>
							<p>If you blacklist a site it will not be logged in the future even when Roxy is in a regular session. Blacklisting will also delete previous visits to this site.</p>
